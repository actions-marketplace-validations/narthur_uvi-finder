# UVI Finder Action

A GitHub Action that automatically identifies [User-Visible Improvements](https://messymatters.com/uvi) (UVIs) in pull requests using OpenAI's API. It analyzes the changes between the base and head branches to detect improvements that would be visible or meaningful to end users.

## Features

- üîç Automatically detects user-visible improvements in PR changes
- ü§ñ Uses OpenAI's API for intelligent analysis
- üí¨ Maintains an up-to-date comment in the PR listing all identified UVIs
- üìä Exposes UVI count and details as outputs for use in other workflow steps
- üîÑ Updates automatically when PR changes

## What is a UVI?

A User-Visible Improvement (UVI) is any change that directly impacts the end user experience. This includes:

- New features users can see or interact with
- Bug fixes that affect user experience
- UI improvements or changes
- Performance improvements noticeable to users
- User-facing text changes (documentation, error messages, labels)
- Accessibility improvements

Internal changes like code refactoring, CI improvements, or developer tooling updates are not considered UVIs since they don't directly affect the end user experience.

## Usage
